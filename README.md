### Install and run in dev mode


You can clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/Sharowalky.git
$ cd Sharowalky
$ yarn install
```

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks, like watch, lint, test, build…


### Run it inside the VM

You can easily view your current running app, you can use the [cozy-stack docker image][cozy-stack-docker]:

```sh
# in a terminal, run your app in watch mode
yarn watch:browser
```

```sh
# in another terminal, run the docker container
# the db and storage folders are used to persist data in the app
# the --rm flag triggers the destruction of the docker container at the end of the execution, as it created each time this command is run.
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 8025:8025 \
    -v "$(pwd)/build":/data/cozy-app \
    -v "$(pwd)/db":/usr/local/couchdb/data \
    -v "$(pwd)/storage":/data/cozy-storage \
    cozy/cozy-app-dev

```
Your app is available at http://sharowalky.cozy.tools:8080.


If you need to go inside the docker container:
```sh
docker ps
docker exec -ti <container-id> /bin/bash
```


### Tests

Tests are run by [mocha] under the hood, and written using [chai] and [sinon]. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.


## Models

The Cozy datastore stores documents, which can be seen as JSON objects. A `doctype` is simply a declaration of the fields in a given JSON object, to store similar objects in an homogeneous fashion.

Cozy ships a [built-in list of `doctypes`][doctypes] for representation of most of the common documents (Bills, Contacts, Files, ...).

Whenever your app needs to use a given `doctype`, you should:

- Check if this is a standard `doctype` defined in Cozy itself. If this is the case, you should add a model declaration in your app containing at least the fields listed in the [main fields list for this `doctype`][doctypes]. Note that you can extend the Cozy-provided `doctype` with your own customs fields. This is typically what is done in [Konnectors] for the [Bill `doctype`][bill-doctype].
- If no standards `doctypes` fit your needs, you should define your own `doctype` in your app. In this case, you do not have to put any field you want in your model, but you should crosscheck other cozy apps to try to homogeneize the names of your fields, so that your `doctype` data could be reused by other apps. This is typically the case for the [Konnector `doctype`][konnector-doctype] in [Konnectors].

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx], which is used by all Cozy's apps.

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim an access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must [configure the transifex client][tx-client], and claim an access as _maintainer_ to the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push -s` command.
